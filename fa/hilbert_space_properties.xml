<title>Hilbert spaces: basic properties and examples (section 1.1)</title>


    <introduction>
        <p>This course assumes real analysis and topology (MAT 601, 701) but not complex analysis. If you did not take MAT 712, omit the example of Bergman spaces in section 1.1.  </p>
<p>Our overarching goal is to unleash the power of linear algebra and topology on spaces of functions. We will find that the <term>completeness</term> of such spaces is essential for our progress. The development of functional analysis was made possible by measure theory advances of early 20th century, which allowed us to define complete spaces of functions in terms of integrals.</p>

<title>Hilbert spaces definition and examples</title>

<p>By definition, a Hilbert space is a complete inner product space. We will unpack this statement step by step.</p>

<p>All our vector spaces are over <m>\mathbb R</m> or <m>\mathbb C</m>; let's make the convention it's <m>\mathbb C</m> unless stated otherwise. So, we can add things and multiply them by complex numbers. Some examples of such spaces:</p>

<p>All functions <m>f: [0,1]\to\mathbb C</m>. Or, all continuous functions. Or, all differentiable. Or integrable. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we could talk about functions <m>f:\Omega\to\mathbb C</m> where <m>\Omega</m> is a completely abstract set; then of course there is no continuity or differentiability.  If <m>\Omega</m> has <m>n</m> elements, this is an <m>n</m>-dimensional space, if infinite; it's infinite-dimensional. 
Sequences are just functions with <m>\Omega=\mathbb N</m>. It is often more convenient to retain the functional notation, writing elements of sequence <m>x</m> as <m>x(k)</m> instead of <m>x_k</m>. </p>

	<title>Inner product</title>

<p>An inner product gives the space geometry: we can talk about orthogonal vectors. Later it also gives the notion of norm, hence of metric. 
By definition the inner product <m>\inn{x,y}</m> is sesquilinear and positive.</p> 

<p>For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the standard inner product is <m>\sum_{k=1}^n x(k)\overline{y(k)}</m>. More generally, if there is a measure <m>\mu</m> on the space <m>\Omega</m>, we can do <m>\int_\Omega  x\overline{y}\,d\mu</m>. Special cases: <m>\Omega=[0, 1]</m> with the Lebesgue measure; <m>\Omega=\mathbb N</m> with counting measure. </p>

<p> We should be more careful with the last example because here because expressions like <m>\sum_{k=1}^\infty x(k)\overline{y(k)}</m> might not converge. One way to avoid this issue it by restricting the set of functions or sequences involved. A convenient example of an inner product space is <m>c_{00}</m> is the space of sequences <m>x:\mathbb N\to\mathbb C</m> such that the support <m>\{k: x(k)\ne 0\}</m> is finite. However, this is not a Hilbert space, as we will see soon. </p>

<p>A more sophisticated approach is to require <m>\sum |x(k)|^2 &lt; \infty</m>; this defines <m>\ell^2</m>, the most basic and most important infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. </p>
</section>

<section xml:id="subsection-hilbert-spaces-norm">
	<title>Norm</title>

<p>In general, a norm is homogeneous, positive except at <m>0</m>, and satisfies the triangle inequality. 
An inner product induces a norm by <m>\|x\|=\sqrt{\inn{x,x}}</m>. The triangle inequality is not obvious, and for it we need the CBS inequalityin its abstract form <m>\abs{\inn{x,y}}\le \|x\| \|y\|</m>. Originally it was proved for sums, then for integrals. Often attributed to Cauchy-Schwarz, omitting Bunyakowsky.</p>

<p>Proof of CBS inequality: <m>0\le \inn{x+ty,x+ty}</m> for real <m>t</m> implies <m>\re \inn{x,y}\le \|x\|\|y\|</m>. Improved by rotating <m>x</m> by a unimodular scalar factor.</p>

<section xml:id="subsection-hilbert-spaces-converge">
	<title>Convergence and completeness</title>

<p>Metric gives us notion of convergence (and everything else: open, closed, compact sets...) In particular, we can ask whether the inner product space is <em>complete</em> (all Cauchy sequences converge). If it is, it's a Hilbert space. Functional analysis with spaces that are not complete is like  real analysis with only rational numbers.</p>

<p>Consider convergence in <m>\ell^2</m>. If <m>x_n\to x</m>, then for every  <m>k</m> <m>x_n(k)\to x(k)</m>. Not conversely. For example, let <m>x_n(k)=1/n</m> if <m>k\le n</m> and <m>0</m> otherwise. This converges pointwise to zero sequence, but not in the norm.</p> 

<p>An example of convergent sequence in <m>\ell^2</m>. Let <m>x_n(k)=1/k</m> if <m>k\le n</m> (otherwise <m>0</m>). Then <m>\{x_n\}</m> converges   to
the sequence <m>x(k)=1/k</m> for all <m>k</m>. Indeed, <m>\|x-x_n\|^2 = \sum_{k>n}1/k^2\to 0</m>.  </p>

<p>As a consequence, <m>c_{00}</m> is not complete. (Why?) </p>

</section>

<section xml:id="subsection-hilbert-spaces-completeness">
	<title>Proof of completeness</title>

<p>Let's prove that <m>\ell^2</m> is complete. The plan is:
<ol>
<li> Given a Cauchy sequence <m>\{x_n\}</m>, prove that it converges coordinate-wise to something (call it <m>x</m>), meaning <m>x_n(k)\to x(k)</m> for <m>k\in \mathbb N</m>. </li>
<li> Prove that the coordinate-wise limit <m>x</m> is also in <m>\ell^2</m>. </li>
<li> Prove that <m>x_n\to x</m> in the <m>\ell^2</m> norm.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Step 1 is easy. Step 2 can be rolled into Step 3, which is the most difficult one. It's very important to realize that knowing 1 and 2 does not imply 3. One uses the Dominated Convergence theorem, but constructing the dominating function is tricky.
